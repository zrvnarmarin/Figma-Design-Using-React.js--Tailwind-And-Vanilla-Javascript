# Figma-Design-Using-React.js--Tailwind-And-Vanilla-Javascript
This is a website which I created based on the Figma design. Techonologies used are React.js, Tailwind and Javascript.
In later iteration I will rewrite project with Typescript.

To see developer version, run npm run dev in terminal.
To see build version of the project, run npm run build or just open the dist folder, as the build version is already created.
